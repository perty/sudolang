When the player enters a cave, they are told the cave's number and which other caves are connected to the current. If any adjacent cave contains a bottomless pit, the player feels he draft from the pit. If any adjacent cave contains the Wumpus, the player feels the smell of the Wumpus. If the adjacent cave has super bats, then the player hears the flaps of their wings.
If the player moves to a cave with a bottomless pit, the player loose. If the player moves to a cave with super bats, the player is transported to a random cave. If the player moves to a cave with the Wumpus, the Wumpus moves to a nearby cave or stays and kill the player.

At each turn the player can either move to another, adjacent cave or shoot an arrow. Arrows travel through caves as instructed by the player up to a maximum of five caves, starting in the current cave. If the arrow can not travel as instructed, a random path is selected. If the arrow reaches the cave where the Wumpus is, it is killed and the player wins. If the arrow comes back to the cave where the player is, the player is killed and loses.

The player has five arrows and loses if all are used without hitting the Wumpus.

Start by putting the player in a random cave.
